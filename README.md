# zip-file-cracker
A  zip file cracker program in python, which is then integrated with C# using IronPython.

We have provided a python script which runs the entire rockyou.txt file, and tries to unlock your zip file with each password. If it matches then, it shows the password or else tells that the search was unsuccesful. 
The, this script is integrated with C# and this is done using IronPython. 
For running this, we had to add the IronPython library to Visual Studio, and then run the program.

You can learn more about IronPython from https://ironpython.net/

Create a zip file and lock it either using 7 zip or using the command line.
Download the famous rockyou.txt file from Kaggle or any other site.(rockyou.txt contains the list of all the common passwords)
